# Covid-19-Death-Predictions
# Note: Do not copy or use any of the content from this project.
This project was part of my Master's research work. It has been year since COVID-19 pandemic hit the world. People lost their loved ones to this disease. Forecasting the deaths due to COVID-19 is very challenging problem as there is so much less data to work on. There are many conventional as well as hybrid neural network models used in Time Series Forecasting. This project compares neural network models for predicting in sample data and future 14 days based on last 21 days data. All models are univariate time series models training and forecasting deaths caused by COVID-19. The results are recorded for Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, Auto Encoder GRU, Auto Encoder LSTM and CNN-LSTM. The primary metrics used for performance measurement is sMAPE and Auto Encoder GRU gives the best results.
